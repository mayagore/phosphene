//! An ObjectiveAI MCP plugin, in as few moving parts as one can have.
//!
//! Everything specific to running inside ObjectiveAI — the transport,
//! the port binding, the `initialize` reply, the command extension —
//! is [`objectiveai_mcp_plugin_framework`]'s job. What is left here is
//! the part that is actually yours: the tools, and what they do.
//!
//! `rename.sh` handles `NAME`, the package and the binary. What is
//! left for you is `PORT` — which must match `mcp.port` in
//! `objectiveai.json`, since the host publishes the port the manifest
//! names — and the tools.
