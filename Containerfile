# Build the VIEWER extension. Declared by `viewer.containerfile` in
# objectiveai.json; the laboratory host builds it with THIS FILE'S OWN
# DIRECTORY as the context, copies `viewer.output` (/dist) out of the
# built image, discards container and image, and packs the contents as
# the installed `viewer/` directory. The image is never STARTED — all
# work happens in RUN steps.
#
# Reproduce a build exactly as the host does:
#
#   podman build -t phosphene-viewer .
#   podman create --name pv phosphene-viewer && podman cp pv:/dist/. out/
#   podman rm pv && podman rmi phosphene-viewer
#
# That sequence is also what CI runs — `pnpm run build` passing locally
# does NOT prove the release build works.
